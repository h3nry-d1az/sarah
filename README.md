Welcome to the main website of the **sarah** project, a *highly reliable*, *easily configurable*, and *extremely lightweight* discord bot written from scratch in the *JavaScript* programming language with just a few dependencies. The **sarah** project is completely *open source*, so feel free to make any changes, report any bugs or strange behaviors, and make suggestions about what you would like to see implemented in the future in this project. Also, if you want to help us indirectly, you can always **give this repository a star** and **share it with your friends**, that would help us a lot.

<br>
<br>

<h2 align="center"> installation </h2>
In the following steps we will guide you through the <i>(very simple)</i> process to successfully <b>install</b> and <b>configure</b> the <b>sarah</b> bot on your favorite discord server.
<br>

1. [Forking and installation](#-forking-and-installation-)
2. [Configuration](#-configuration-)
3. [Bot deployment](#-bot-deployment-)
4. [Adding more commands](#-adding-more-commands-)

<br>

<h4 align="center"> Forking and installation </h4>
To install <b>sarah</b> on your favorite discord server, you will first have to <i>fork</i> this repository, a simple task that can be done by clicking on the <code>fork</code> button of this repository, as shown in the image below:
<div align="center"><img src="./assets/forking.gif" height=110px></div>
Then, wait a bit until the forking process has finished and thus, you have created your own branch of this bot. Now, you can give the repository the name you want and we can continue with the next step.

<br>

<h4 align="center"> Configuration </h4>
After having created your own fork of the <b>sarah</b> bot, it's time to configure it to adapt it to the needs of your own server, in general, we would like to tell you that you can do this by editing the file <code>sarah/settings/settings.json</code>, however, you are probably looking for one more rigorous and specific documentation on what each of the sections is for, if this is what you want, you should take a look at the <a href="docs/settings.md">documentation page of the settings.json module</a>.

<br>

<h4 align="center"> Bot deployment </h4>
And finally you will only have to mount your deployment workflow on your <b>sarah</b> fork (this can be done using platforms like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>) and your discord bot should be successfully deployed, so you should see an environment like the one below in your repository:
<div align="center"><img src="./assets/environment.gif" height=80px></div>

<br>

<h4 align="center"> Adding more commands </h4>
Also, you probably want to add more commands to your bot than <b>sarah</b> has, this is a simple task, but one that you can do manually or using the <b>CLI</b> that <b>sarah</b> includes:

<br>

<h6 align="center">Adding commands manually</h6>
<ol>
  <li> Firstly, you need to create its own JavaScript module in the <code>./sarah/commands/</code> directory, which must be called <code>[command].js</code>.</li>
  <li> Then, write the command program within its main function, which must be called <code>[command]cmd</code> and must recieve five arguments: <code>message, args, client, _, __</code> <i>(the last two arguments are useless, but your function must recieve them; otherwise it will generate an error)</i>. </li>
  <li> And finally go to the <code>commands</code> section of the <code>settings.json</code> module and add your command there as an object with the following properties:</li></ol>
<ul>
  <li><b>name</b>: <code>string</code></li>
  <li><b>desc</b>: <code>string</code></li>
  <li><b>path</b>: <code>string</code></li>
  <li><b>admin</b>: <code>bool</code></li>
  <li><b>state</b>: <code>0</code> or <code>1</code></li>
  <li><b>log</b>: <code>bool</code></li>
  <li><b>logicon</b>: <code>string</code></li>
  <li><b>logmsg</b>: <code>string</code></li>
  <li><b>logcolor</b>: <code>string</code></li>
  <li><b>ondev</b>: <code>bool</code></li>
</ul>

<br>
<h6 align="center">Adding commands using <b>sarah</b>'s <b>CLI</b></h6> 
<ol>
  <li>First of all, you will have to make sure that the dependencies of the project are installed, if they are not, you can solve the problem by executing the <code>$ npm i</code> command</li>
  <li>Then, you will have to obtain the name of the user who created the project and the name of the repository of the command to install, this obviously on the <b>GitHub</b> platform, from where the command will be obtained.</li>
  <li>And finally execute the command <code>node ./addcmd.js [user] [repo]</code> replacing <code>[user]</code> with the user in question and <code>[repo]</code> with the name of the repository, you can see an example below:
  <div align="center"><img src="./assets/addcmd.gif"></div></li>
</ol>

If you followed the steps correctly either way, you should have your command <b>ready to run</b> on your server.

<br>
<br>

<h2 align="center"> commands </h2>
The <b>sarah</b> bot comes by default with a wide variety of useful commands for your server, which we are detailed below. With this purpose in mind, we would like to detail the notation used below:
